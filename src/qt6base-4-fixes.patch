+CHANGES BETWEEN 2.10.3 and 2.10.4
+
+  I. IMPORTANT BUG FIXES
+
+  - A heap buffer overflow has been found  in the handling of embedded
+    PNG bitmaps, introduced in FreeType version 2.6.
+
+      https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15999
+
+    If you  use option  FT_CONFIG_OPTION_USE_PNG  you  should  upgrade
+    immediately.
+
+
+======================================================================
+
+CHANGES BETWEEN 2.10.2 and 2.10.3
+
+  I. IMPORTANT CHANGES
+
+  - New flag `FT_OUTLINE_OVERLAP'.  If set, make the smooth rasterizer
+    do  4x4 oversampling  to  mitigate artifacts  in pixels  partially
+    covered  by  overlapping  contours.    Note  that  this  at  least
+    quadruples the rendering time.
+
+    If  a  glyph  in  a  TrueType font  has  the  `OVERLAP_SIMPLE'  or
+    `OVERLAP_COMPOUND'  bit set,  FreeType automatically  selects this
+    rendering mode.
+
+
+  II. MISCELLANEOUS
+
+  - Using the  arcane method of  including FreeType header  files with
+    macros like  `FT_FREETYPE_H' is no longer  mandatory (but retained
+    as an optional feature for backward compatibility).
+
+  - Support for  building the library  with Meson.  Building  the demo
+    programs with Meson will follow in a forthcoming release.
+
+  - Minor improvements to the B/W rasterizer.
+
+  - Auto-hinter support for Medefaidrin script.
+
+  - Fix various  memory leaks (mainly  for CFF) and other  issues that
+    might cause crashes in rare circumstances.
+
+  - Jam support has been removed.
+
+  - In  `ftview', custom  LCD  filter values  are  now normalized  and
+    balanced.  Unorthodox filters are still available through the `-L'
+    command line option.
+
+  - The GUI demo programs can now be resized.
+
+  - Demo programs that accept command  line option `-k' can now handle
+    function keys, too.  The  corresponding character codes start with
+    0xF1.  As  an example, the  POSIX shell syntax (accepted  by bash,
+    ksh, and zsh)
+
+      -k $'\xF3q'
+
+    emulates the pressing of function key `F3' followed by key `q'.
+
+
+======================================================================
+
+CHANGES BETWEEN 2.10.1 and 2.10.2
+
+  I. IMPORTANT CHANGES
+
+  - Support  of  WOFF2  fonts.   This  code  contribution  was  Nikhil
+    Ramakrishnan's GSoC 2019 project.
+
+
+  II. MISCELLANEOUS
+
+  - Function  `FT_Get_Var_Axis_Flags' returned random data for  Type 1
+    MM fonts.
+
+  - Type 1 fonts with non-integer metrics are now supported by the new
+    (CFF) engine introduced in FreeType 2.9.
+
+  - Drop  support  for Python 2 in Freetype's API reference  generator
+    `docwriter'  (Python >= 3.5 is required for targets  `make refdoc'
+    and `make refdoc-venv').
+
+  - Auto-hinter support for Hanifi Rohingya.
+
+  - Document the `FT2_KEEP_ALIVE' debugging environment variable.
+
+  - The Visual C++ (and Visual C)  project files for Windows builds no
+    longer generate libraries that contain the FreeType version in its
+    filenames.   Instead,  a  resource  file gets  used  to  make  the
+    libraries contain the corresponding information.
+
+  - The next release will remove Jam build support.
+
+  - The  `ftbench'  demo  program  has  a new  test  for  testing  the
+    `FT_Glyph_Stroke' functionality.

-   *   to be controlled by so-called `features'.  Handling OpenType features
-   *   can be quite complicated and thus needs a separate library on top of
-   *   FreeType.
-   *
-   *   The mapping between glyph indices and scripts (in the auto-hinter
-   *   sense, see the @FT_AUTOHINTER_SCRIPT_XXX values) is stored as an
-   *   array with `num_glyphs' elements, as found in the font's @FT_Face
-   *   structure.  The `glyph-to-script-map' property returns a pointer to
-   *   this array, which can be modified as needed.  Note that the
-   *   modification should happen before the first glyph gets processed by
-   *   the auto-hinter so that the global analysis of the font shapes
-   *   actually uses the modified mapping.
-   *
-   *   The following example code demonstrates how to access it (omitting
-   *   the error handling).
-   *
-   *   {
-   *     FT_Library                library;
-   *     FT_Face                   face;
-   *     FT_Prop_GlyphToScriptMap  prop;
-   *

-   *     FT_Init_FreeType( &library );
-   *     FT_New_Face( library, "foo.ttf", 0, &face );

-   *   If FreeType gets compiled with option AF_CONFIG_OPTION_USE_WARPER to

-   *   switches warping on and off.
-   *
-   *   Warping only works in `light' auto-hinting mode.  The idea of the

-   *   its segments are aligned (more or less) to the grid.  To find out a
-   *   glyph's optimal scaling and shifting value, various parameter
-   *   combinations are tried and scored.
-   *
-   *   By default, warping is off.  The example below shows how to switch on

-   *
-   * @note:
-   *   This property can be used with @FT_Property_Get also.
-   *
-   *   The warping code can also change advance widths.  Have a look at the
-   *   `lsb_delta' and `rsb_delta' fields in the @FT_GlyphSlotRec structure
-   *   for details on improving inter-glyph distances while rendering.
-   *
-   *   Since warping is a global property of the auto-hinter it is best to
-   *   change its value before rendering any face.  Otherwise, you should

-   * @title:
-   *   The CFF driver
-   *
-   * @abstract:
-   *   Controlling the CFF driver module.
-   *
-   * @description:
-   *   While FreeType's CFF driver doesn't expose API functions by itself,
-   *   it is possible to control its behaviour with @FT_Property_Set and
-   *   @FT_Property_Get.  The list below gives the available properties
-   *   together with the necessary macros and structures.
-   *
-   *   The CFF driver's module name is `cff'.
-   *
-   *   *Hinting* *and* *antialiasing* *principles* *of* *the* *new* *engine*
-   *
-   *   The rasterizer is positioning horizontal features (e.g., ascender
-   *   height & x-height, or crossbars) on the pixel grid and minimizing the
-   *   amount of antialiasing applied to them, while placing vertical
-   *   features (vertical stems) on the pixel grid without hinting, thus
-   *   representing the stem position and weight accurately.  Sometimes the
-   *   vertical stems may be only partially black.  In this context,
-   *   `antialiasing' means that stems are not positioned exactly on pixel
-   *   borders, causing a fuzzy appearance.
-   *
-   *   There are two principles behind this approach.
-   *
-   *   1) No hinting in the horizontal direction: Unlike `superhinted'
-   *   TrueType, which changes glyph widths to accommodate regular
-   *   inter-glyph spacing, Adobe's approach is `faithful to the design' in
-   *   representing both the glyph width and the inter-glyph spacing
-   *   designed for the font.  This makes the screen display as close as it
-   *   can be to the result one would get with infinite resolution, while
-   *   preserving what is considered the key characteristics of each glyph.
-   *   Note that the distances between unhinted and grid-fitted positions at
-   *   small sizes are comparable to kerning values and thus would be
-   *   noticeable (and distracting) while reading if hinting were applied.
-   *
-   *   One of the reasons to not hint horizontally is antialiasing for LCD
-   *   screens: The pixel geometry of modern displays supplies three
-   *   vertical sub-pixels as the eye moves horizontally across each visible
-   *   pixel.  On devices where we can be certain this characteristic is
-   *   present a rasterizer can take advantage of the sub-pixels to add
-   *   increments of weight.  In Western writing systems this turns out to
-   *   be the more critical direction anyway; the weights and spacing of
-   *   vertical stems (see above) are central to Armenian, Cyrillic, Greek,
-   *   and Latin type designs.  Even when the rasterizer uses greyscale
-   *   antialiasing instead of color (a necessary compromise when one
-   *   doesn't know the screen characteristics), the unhinted vertical
-   *   features preserve the design's weight and spacing much better than
-   *   aliased type would.
-   *
-   *   2) Aligment in the vertical direction: Weights and spacing along the
-   *   y~axis are less critical; what is much more important is the visual
-   *   alignment of related features (like cap-height and x-height).  The
-   *   sense of alignment for these is enhanced by the sharpness of grid-fit
-   *   edges, while the cruder vertical resolution (full pixels instead of
-   *   1/3 pixels) is less of a problem.
-   *
-   *   On the technical side, horizontal alignment zones for ascender,
-   *   x-height, and other important height values (traditionally called
-   *   `blue zones') as defined in the font are positioned independently,
-   *   each being rounded to the nearest pixel edge, taking care of
-   *   overshoot suppression at small sizes, stem darkening, and scaling.
-   *
-   *   Hstems (this is, hint values defined in the font to help align
-   *   horizontal features) that fall within a blue zone are said to be
-   *   `captured' and are aligned to that zone.  Uncaptured stems are moved
-   *   in one of four ways, top edge up or down, bottom edge up or down.
-   *   Unless there are conflicting hstems, the smallest movement is taken
-   *   to minimize distortion.

-   *   The x~values give the stem width, and the y~values the darkening

-   *   positive; the x~values must be monotonically increasing; the

-   * @title:
-   *   The TrueType driver
-   *
-   * @abstract:
-   *   Controlling the TrueType driver module.
-   *
-   * @description:
-   *   While FreeType's TrueType driver doesn't expose API functions by
-   *   itself, it is possible to control its behaviour with @FT_Property_Set
-   *   and @FT_Property_Get.  The following lists the available properties
-   *   together with the necessary macros and structures.
-   *
-   *   The TrueType driver's module name is `truetype'.
-   *
-   *   We start with a list of definitions, kindly provided by Greg
-   *   Hitchcock.
-   *
-   *   _Bi-Level_ _Rendering_
-   *
-   *   Monochromatic rendering, exclusively used in the early days of
-   *   TrueType by both Apple and Microsoft.  Microsoft's GDI interface
-   *   supported hinting of the right-side bearing point, such that the
-   *   advance width could be non-linear.  Most often this was done to
-   *   achieve some level of glyph symmetry.  To enable reasonable
-   *   performance (e.g., not having to run hinting on all glyphs just to
-   *   get the widths) there was a bit in the head table indicating if the
-   *   side bearing was hinted, and additional tables, `hdmx' and `LTSH', to
-   *   cache hinting widths across multiple sizes and device aspect ratios.
-   *
-   *   _Font_ _Smoothing_
-   *
-   *   Microsoft's GDI implementation of anti-aliasing.  Not traditional
-   *   anti-aliasing as the outlines were hinted before the sampling.  The
-   *   widths matched the bi-level rendering.
-   *
-   *   _ClearType_ _Rendering_
-   *
-   *   Technique that uses physical subpixels to improve rendering on LCD
-   *   (and other) displays.  Because of the higher resolution, many methods
-   *   of improving symmetry in glyphs through hinting the right-side
-   *   bearing were no longer necessary.  This lead to what GDI calls
-   *   `natural widths' ClearType, see
-   *   http://www.beatstamm.com/typography/RTRCh4.htm#Sec21.  Since hinting
-   *   has extra resolution, most non-linearity went away, but it is still
-   *   possible for hints to change the advance widths in this mode.
-   *
-   *   _ClearType_ _Compatible_ _Widths_
-   *
-   *   One of the earliest challenges with ClearType was allowing the
-   *   implementation in GDI to be selected without requiring all UI and
-   *   documents to reflow.  To address this, a compatible method of
-   *   rendering ClearType was added where the font hints are executed once
-   *   to determine the width in bi-level rendering, and then re-run in
-   *   ClearType, with the difference in widths being absorbed in the font
-   *   hints for ClearType (mostly in the white space of hints); see
-   *   http://www.beatstamm.com/typography/RTRCh4.htm#Sec20.  Somewhat by
-   *   definition, compatible width ClearType allows for non-linear widths,
-   *   but only when the bi-level version has non-linear widths.
-   *
-   *   _ClearType_ _Subpixel_ _Positioning_
-   *
-   *   One of the nice benefits of ClearType is the ability to more crisply
-   *   display fractional widths; unfortunately, the GDI model of integer
-   *   bitmaps did not support this.  However, the WPF and Direct Write
-   *   frameworks do support fractional widths.  DWrite calls this `natural
-   *   mode', not to be confused with GDI's `natural widths'.  Subpixel
-   *   positioning, in the current implementation of Direct Write,
-   *   unfortunately does not support hinted advance widths, see
-   *   http://www.beatstamm.com/typography/RTRCh4.htm#Sec22.  Note that the
-   *   TrueType interpreter fully allows the advance width to be adjusted in
-   *   this mode, just the DWrite client will ignore those changes.
-   *
-   *   _ClearType_ _Backwards_ _Compatibility_
-   *
-   *   This is a set of exceptions made in the TrueType interpreter to
-   *   minimize hinting techniques that were problematic with the extra
-   *   resolution of ClearType; see
-   *   http://www.beatstamm.com/typography/RTRCh4.htm#Sec1 and
-   *   http://www.microsoft.com/typography/cleartype/truetypecleartype.aspx.
-   *   This technique is not to be confused with ClearType compatible
-   *   widths.  ClearType backwards compatibility has no direct impact on
-   *   changing advance widths, but there might be an indirect impact on
-   *   disabling some deltas.  This could be worked around in backwards
-   *   compatibility mode.
-   *
-   *   _Native_ _ClearType_ _Mode_
-   *
-   *   (Not to be confused with `natural widths'.)  This mode removes all
-   *   the exceptions in the TrueType interpreter when running with
-   *   ClearType.  Any issues on widths would still apply, though.

-   * @property:
-   *   interpreter-version
-   *
-   * @description:
-   *   Currently, two versions are available, representing the bytecode
-   *   interpreter with and without subpixel hinting support,
-   *   respectively.  The default is subpixel support if
-   *   TT_CONFIG_OPTION_SUBPIXEL_HINTING is defined, and no subpixel
-   *   support otherwise (since it isn't available then).
-   *
-   *   If subpixel hinting is on, many TrueType bytecode instructions behave
-   *   differently compared to B/W or grayscale rendering (except if `native
-   *   ClearType' is selected by the font).  The main idea is to render at a
-   *   much increased horizontal resolution, then sampling down the created
-   *   output to subpixel precision.  However, many older fonts are not
-   *   suited to this and must be specially taken care of by applying
-   *   (hardcoded) font-specific tweaks.
-   *
-   *   Details on subpixel hinting and some of the necessary tweaks can be
-   *   found in Greg Hitchcock's whitepaper at
-   *   `http://www.microsoft.com/typography/cleartype/truetypecleartype.aspx'.
-   *
-   *   The following example code demonstrates how to activate subpixel
-   *   hinting (omitting the error handling).
-   *
-   *   {
-   *     FT_Library  library;
-   *     FT_Face     face;
-   *     FT_UInt     interpreter_version = TT_INTERPRETER_VERSION_38;
-   *
-   *
-   *     FT_Init_FreeType( &library );
-   *
-   *     FT_Property_Set( library, "truetype",
-   *                               "interpreter-version",
-   *                               &interpreter_version );
-   *   }
-   *
-   * @note:
-   *   This property can be used with @FT_Property_Get also.

-   * @enum:
-   *   TT_INTERPRETER_VERSION_XXX
-   *
-   * @description:
-   *   A list of constants used for the @interpreter-version property to
-   *   select the hinting engine for Truetype fonts.
-   *
-   *   The numeric value in the constant names represents the version
-   *   number as returned by the `GETINFO' bytecode instruction.
-   *
-   * @values:
-   *   TT_INTERPRETER_VERSION_35 ::
-   *     Version~35 corresponds to MS rasterizer v.1.7 as used e.g. in
-   *     Windows~98; only grayscale and B/W rasterizing is supported.
-   *
-   *   TT_INTERPRETER_VERSION_38 ::
-   *     Version~38 corresponds to MS rasterizer v.1.9; it is roughly
-   *     equivalent to the hinting provided by DirectWrite ClearType (as
-   *     can be found, for example, in the Internet Explorer~9 running on
-   *     Windows~7).
-   *
-   * @note:
-   *   This property controls the behaviour of the bytecode interpreter
-   *   and thus how outlines get hinted.  It does *not* control how glyph
-   *   get rasterized!  In particular, it does not control subpixel color
-   *   filtering.
-   *
-   *   If FreeType has not been compiled with configuration option
-   *   FT_CONFIG_OPTION_SUBPIXEL_HINTING, selecting version~38 causes an
-   *   `FT_Err_Unimplemented_Feature' error.
-   *
-   *   Depending on the graphics framework, Microsoft uses different
-   *   bytecode and rendering engines.  As a consequence, the version
-   *   numbers returned by a call to the `GETINFO' bytecode instruction are
-   *   more convoluted than desired.
-   *
-   *   Here are two tables that try to shed some light on the possible
-   *   values for the MS rasterizer engine, together with the additional
-   *   features introduced by it.

-   *   The `version' field gives a rough orientation only, since some

-   *   Windows 2000).  Similarly, updates to a given framework might include

-   *
-   *   Color and Gray ClearType are the two available variants of
-   *   `Y-direction ClearType', meaning grayscale rasterization along the
-   *   Y-direction; the name used in the TrueType specification for this
-   *   feature is `symmetric smoothing'.  `Classic ClearType' is the
-   *   original algorithm used before introducing a modified version in
-   *   Win~XP.  Another name for v1.6's grayscale rendering is `font
-   *   smoothing', and `Color ClearType' is sometimes also called `DWrite
-   *   ClearType'.  To differentiate between today's Color ClearType and the
-   *   earlier ClearType variant with B/W rendering along the vertical axis,
-   *   the latter is sometimes called `GDI ClearType'.
-   *
-   *   `Normal' and `high' sampling describe the (virtual) resolution to
-   *   access the rasterized outline after the hinting process.  `Normal'
-   *   means 1 sample per grid line (i.e., B/W).  In the current Microsoft
-   *   implementation, `high' means an extra virtual resolution of 16x16 (or
-   *   16x1) grid lines per pixel for bytecode instructions like `MIRP'.
-   *   After hinting, these 16 grid lines are mapped to 6x5 (or 6x1) grid
-   *   lines for color filtering if Color ClearType is activated.
-   *
-   *   Note that `Gray ClearType' is essentially the same as v1.6's
-   *   grayscale rendering.  However, the GETINFO instruction handles it
-   *   differently: v1.6 returns bit~12 (hinting for grayscale), while v2.1
-   *   returns bits~13 (hinting for ClearType), 18 (symmetrical smoothing),
-   *   and~19 (Gray ClearType).  Also, this mode respects bits 2 and~3 for
-   *   the version~1 gasp table exclusively (like Color ClearType), while
-   *   v1.6 only respects the values of version~0 (bits 0 and~1).
-   *
-   *   FreeType doesn't provide all capabilities of the most recent
-   *   ClearType incarnation, thus we identify our subpixel support as
-   *   version~38.

-     * Various OpenType features might use the same glyphs at different
-     * vertical positions; for example, superscript and subscript glyphs
-     * could be the same.  However, the auto-hinter is completely
-     * agnostic of OpenType features after the feature analysis has been
-     * completed: The engine then simply receives a glyph index and returns a
-     * hinted and usually rendered glyph.
-     *
-     * Consider the superscript feature of font `pala.ttf': Some of the
-     * glyphs are `real', this is, they have a zero vertical offset, but
-     * most of them are small caps glyphs shifted up to the superscript
-     * position (this is, the `sups' feature is present in both the GSUB and
-     * GPOS tables).  The code for blue zones computation actually uses a
-     * feature's y offset so that the `real' glyphs get correct hints.  But
-     * later on it is impossible to decide whether a glyph index belongs to,
-     * say, the small caps or superscript feature.
-     *
-     * For this reason, we don't assign a style to a glyph if the current
-     * feature covers the glyph in both the GSUB and the GPOS tables.  This
-     * is quite a broad condition, assuming that
-     *
-     *   (a) glyphs that get used in multiple features are present in a
-     *       feature without vertical shift,
-     *
-     * and
-     *
-     *   (b) a feature's GPOS data really moves the glyph vertically.
-     *
-     * Not fulfilling condition (a) makes a font larger; it would also
-     * reduce the number of glyphs that could be addressed directly without
-     * using OpenType features, so this assumption is rather strong.
-     *
-     * Condition (b) is much weaker, and there might be glyphs which get
-     * missed.  However, the OpenType features we are going to handle are
-     * primarily located in GSUB, and HarfBuzz doesn't provide an API to
-     * directly get the necessary information from the GPOS table.  A
-     * possible solution might be to directly parse the GPOS table to find
-     * out whether a glyph gets shifted vertically, but this is something I
-     * would like to avoid if not really necessary.
-     *
-     * Note that we don't follow this logic for the default coverage.
-     * Complex scripts like Devanagari have mandatory GPOS features to
-     * position many glyph elements, using mark-to-base or mark-to-ligature
-     * tables; the number of glyphs missed due to condition (b) would be far
-     * too large.

-   * A poor-man error facility.
-   *
-   * This code being written in vanilla C, doesn't have the luxury of a
-   * language-supported exception mechanism such as the one available in
-   * Java.  Instead, we are stuck with using error codes that must be
-   * carefully managed and preserved.  However, it is convenient for us to
-   * model our error mechanism on a Java-like exception mechanism.
-   * When we assign an error code we are thus `throwing' an error.
-   *
-   * The perservation of an error code is done by coding convention.
-   * Upon a function call if the error code is anything other than
-   * `FT_Err_Ok', which is guaranteed to be zero, we
-   * will return without altering that error.  This will allow the
-   * error to propogate and be handled at the appropriate location in
-   * the code.
-   *
-   * This allows a style of code where the error code is initialized
-   * up front and a block of calls are made with the error code only
-   * being checked after the block.  If a new error occurs, the original
-   * error will be preserved and a functional no-op should result in any
-   * subsequent function that has an initial error code not equal to
-   * `FT_Err_Ok'.
-   *
-   * Errors are encoded by calling the `FT_THROW' macro.  For example,
-   *
-   * {
-   *   FT_Error  e;
-   *
-   *
-   *   ...
-   *   e = FT_THROW( Out_Of_Memory );

-##  The `column' pattern must contain a group to `unbox' the content of
-##  documentation comment blocks.
-##
-##  Later on, paragraphs are converted to long lines, which simplifies the
-##  regular expressions that act upon the text.

-     You  also need  the header  files from  the `libarchive'  library
-     (https://www.libarchive.org/)  for handling  tar files  (see file
-     `ftmutator.cc' below for more).
-
-  2. Link with `libFuzzer' (it contains `main') and `libarchive'.
-
-  3. Run the fuzzer on some test corpus.
-
-The exact flags and commands may vary.
-
-  https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/tree/master/projects/freetype2
-
-There is a continuous fuzzing bot that runs ftfuzzer.
-
-  https://oss-fuzz.com
-
-(You need an account  to be able to see coverage  reports and the like
-on oss-fuzz.com.)
-
-Check the bot configuration for the most current settings.

-ftmutator.cc
-------------
-
-FreeType has the  ability to `attach' auxiliary files to  a font file,
-providing additional information.  The main usage is to load AFM files
-for PostScript Type 1 fonts.
-
-However, libFuzzer currently only supports  mutation of a single input
-file.   For  this  reason,  `ftmutator.cc' contains  a  custom  fuzzer
-mutator that uses an uncompressed tar  file archive as the input.  The
-first file in  such a tarball gets  opened by FreeType as  a font, all
-other files are treated as input for `FT_Attach_Stream'.
-
-Compilation is similar to `ftfuzzer.c'.
-
-
-runinput.cc
------------
-
-To run the target function on a set of input files, this file contains
-a   convenience  `main'   function.   Link   it  with   `ftfuzzer.cc',
-`libfreetype.a', and `libarchive' and run like
-
-  ./a.out my_tests_inputs/*

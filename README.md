MXE (M cross environment) is a Makefile that compiles a cross compiler and many free libraries.

This is a modified and minimal version of MXE specifically to build [Strawberry](https://github.com/strawberrymusicplayer/strawberry).
Feel free to make use of it if you need something.

See [MXE](https://github.com/mxe/mxe) for the official and full version.

Some of the libraries here are:

  * GCC 11
  * pthreads
  * Boost
  * CMake
  * Protobuf
  * GLib
  * GStreamer
  * GnuTLS
  * OpenSSL
  * SQLite
  * FFTW
  * Qt 6
  * TagLib

Differences from the official repositories:

  * Up-to-date core packages, GLib, libsoup and pango.
  * Qt 6 has only SQL support for sqlite.
  * GStreamer has only audio specific plugins.
